Todo list app made with Vanilla JavaScript. 

In this simple app we are able to to add new tasks to be done, delete tasks, mark tasks as completed and filter tasks on basis of completed or incompleted tasks.

Things I've learned while doing it:
1. How to create/delete DOM elements dinamically with JavaScript.
2. How to implement local storage and save tasks in our local storage.
3. How to style DOM elements by adding/removing classes dinamically with JavaScript.
